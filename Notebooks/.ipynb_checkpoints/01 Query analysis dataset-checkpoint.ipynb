    "Modern drug discovery requires researchers to: a) identify a therapeutic target, or a molecule structure whose abnormal activity is associated with a disease, and b) design drugs to act on these therapeutic targets. Both stages of this process are costly and time-intensive. Therefore, it's crucial to devise strategies to improve the efficiency of this search. One such strategy has been to develop a more comprehensive understanding of therapeutic targets and their interaction properties. For example, the number of drug-target interaction publications has increased over the past several years, as have the number of efforts to consolidate the information into useful databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, much of the data remains unstructured, waiting to be extracted and curated by human experts. The growing number of scientific publications makes it infeasible to manually sift through all the available literature.  Rather, we first need to find a way to distinguish the relevant documents from the mass of irrelevant ones. To that end, this Jupyter notebook introduces a document classifier that's able to successfully identify articles that contain drug-target interaction information and those that do not. "

This information can be found in the \"target_dictionary\" and \"target_type\" tables. The \"target_dictionary\" table contains the target IDs that we can map to the specific assays (\"tid\"), and the \"target_type\" table categorizes the targets into distinct, high-level classes (e.g., \"PROTEIN,\", \"MOLECULAR,\" \"NON-MOLECULAR,\" etc.). We are only interested in querying documents associated with \"PROTEIN\" targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"assays\" table stores the list of all the assays extracted from the documents. This table contains a variety of useful fields that map to other tables. Specifically, the \"doc_id\" field maps to the \"doc_id\" field in the \"docs\" table, and the \"tid\" field maps to the \"tid\" field in the \"target_dictionary\" table. Note that the majority of assays associated with a \"PROTEIN\" target are binding assays (we confirm this with the query directly below). To simplify our analysis dataset, we will only query documents associated with binding assays."
